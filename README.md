# AI TOOLTIP COMPANY BRAIN

Give your company a persistent source of truth that your team and AI can work from.

**FILES = COMPANY MEMORY**

**AI = INTERFACE**

The Company Brain keeps knowledge, goals, history, approved decisions, projects, brand information, research, references, assets, outputs, and meaningful activity in files you control. AI can research, organize, propose, identify implications, execute approved work, and maintain approved knowledge. Humans remain responsible for company decisions.

## GET STARTED

1. Download this repository from **Code → Download ZIP**.
2. Unzip it.
3. Add existing company material to `00-INBOX`.
4. Open the whole folder in any file-aware AI assistant — Cursor, Claude, Copilot, a local model via Ollama, or any tool that can read and write files.
5. Say: **“Set up my company brain.”**

That's it. The AI analyzes existing material first, asks only for important missing information, and requests approval before establishing consequential conclusions.

Once your local identity is established, say **“Hi”** or **“Hello.”** The Brain will greet you by name, recap the latest dated company activity, and suggest useful next actions based on your role and current work.

## USED MY PREVIOUS AI TOOLTIP VIDEOS?

1. Put your old `AI-DESIGN-SKILLS` and/or `codex-design-studio` folder into `00-MIGRATE-OLD-SETUP/`.
2. Say: **“Migrate my previous AI Tooltip setup.”**

The migration preserves useful brand information, skills, references, assets, projects, outputs, Storybook systems, and Theme Editors while excluding obsolete prompts and generated dependencies.

## SOLO

Download the ZIP, keep it locally, and open it with any file-aware AI assistant. You do not need Git or a GitHub account after download. Read [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md) for the short walkthrough.

## TEAM

Use a **private GitHub repository** for your actual company. GitHub Desktop is recommended for non-technical teammates.

`Pull/sync → work → review meaningful changes → commit → push`

The public AI Tooltip repository is the framework and update source. Your private repository is the actual Company Brain. **Do not use a public fork for confidential company data.** See [COLLABORATION.md](COLLABORATION.md).

## PRIVACY

The persistent Company Brain lives in files you control, reducing dependence on AI-provider chat memory. This does **not** mean cloud AI providers never receive the information. When you ask Codex, Claude, or another cloud service to work with files, relevant content may be sent to that provider for processing. Local files do not automatically make AI processing private or offline.

Read [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and review the settings and policies of each AI provider you use.

## UPDATES

Say **“Check for AI Tooltip updates.”** The read-only checker uses stable releases from the official repository and does not require Git. It shows the current/latest versions, framework changes, files involved, and possible customization conflicts. Nothing is installed automatically.

Only after reviewing the report may you say **“Apply the approved update.”** Company-owned files and existing unlisted files are never automatic overwrite targets.
